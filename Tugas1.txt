1. Write a program using Python that reads in the user's salary and divides the number by 12 months. 
   The monthly salary should be output to the console with 0 decimal places rounded up. 
   For example, if the user enters 60000 the program should display 5000. The file should be name task1.py.

2. Write a program that reads in a whole number and divides it by 3 and 
   displays the result with three decimal places if they exist (rounded up). 
   For example, if the user enters 2 the program should display 0.667. 
   For example, if the user enters 9999 the program should display 3,333.0. The file should be name task2.py.

3. Write a program that reads in a number and prints the either Small, 
   Medium or Large depending on if the number is below 100 or above 200. 
   For example, if the user enters 150 the program should display “Medium”. 
   Another example, is if the user enters 50 the program should display “Small”. The file should be name task3.py.

4. Write a program that reads in a number and prints the sum of all values from 1 up to the number. 
   For example, if the user enters 5 the program should display 15. 15 is (1+2+3+4+5). The file should be named task4.py.

5. Write a program that reads in numbers until a -1 is entered and prints the sum of all numbers entered. 
   For example, if the user enters 5 10 15 -1 the program should display 30 (Each number will be separated by a carriage return). 30 is (5+10+15). The file should be named task5.py.
